# Watchtower

A self-hosted CCTV system using an ESP32-CAM for video capture and a Node.js server for motion detection, human recognition, recording, and live monitoring via a web dashboard.

## Architecture

```
ESP32-CAM ──MJPEG/HTTP──> Node.js Server ──WebSocket──> Browser Dashboard
                              │
                              ├── SQLite (recordings, events, logs)
                              ├── Sharp (motion detection)
                              └── TensorFlow.js (human detection)
```

- **ESP32-CAM** streams MJPEG over HTTP, accepts runtime settings commands (resolution, quality, mirror, flip, flash, brightness, contrast).
- **Node.js server** polls frames, detects motion (frame diffing via Sharp), detects humans (COCO-SSD), records segments, stores events in SQLite.
- **Browser dashboard** single-page app (HTML/CSS/JS) with live view, event browsing, alerts, camera settings, system logs.


## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-CAM module (AI-Thinker or compatible with OV2640)
- 5V power supply (2A minimum; the ESP32-CAM draws ~300mA with flash off)
- Micro-USB to UART programmer (for initial firmware upload)
- Optional: LED on GPIO 4 for flash (see safety notes below)

## Setup

### 1. ESP32-CAM Firmware

1. Open `esp32-sketch/ESP32_CAM_Streamer/ESP32_CAM_Streamer.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Install ESP32 board support (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).
3. Install the `esp32-camera` library.
4. Set your WiFi credentials in the sketch:
   ```cpp
   const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourSSID";
   const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword";
   ```
5. Select board: **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**.
6. Set upload speed: **115200**.
7. Connect GPIO 0 to GND, power cycle, click Upload.
8. After upload, disconnect GPIO 0 from GND and reset.
9. Check the Serial Monitor for the assigned IP address.

### 2. Node.js Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure cameras
# Edit config.json — set your ESP32-CAM's IP address in cameras[].stream_url

# Start the server
node server.js
```

The server listens on `http://0.0.0.0:3000` by default.

### 3. Dashboard

Open `http://<server-ip>:3000` in a browser.

## Configuration

### config.json

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `server.port` | HTTP server port |
| `server.host` | Bind address |
| `cameras[].id` | Numeric camera ID |
| `cameras[].name` | Display name |
| `cameras[].stream_url` | MJPEG stream URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:81/stream`) |
| `cameras[].snapshot_url` | Snapshot URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:81/capture`) |
| `cameras[].config_url` | Base URL for settings commands (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:81`) |
| `cameras[].fps` | Polling frame rate |
| `motion_detection.threshold` | Sensitivity threshold (lower = more sensitive) |
| `motion_detection.sensitivity` | Pixel change sensitivity |
| `human_detection.confidence_threshold` | Minimum confidence for human detection |
| `recording.retention_days` | Days to keep recordings before cleanup |
| `recording.continuous` | Continous recording vs. motion-only |
| `storage.recordings_path` | Directory for recorded segments |
| `storage.snapshots_path` | Directory for event snapshots |

### Camera Settings (Runtime)

Settings can be changed via the dashboard (Camera Settings modal) without reflashing the ESP32:

- **Resolution**: QVGA (320×240), VGA (640×480), SVGA (800×600), HD (1280×720), SXGA (1280×1024), UXGA (1600×1200)
- **JPEG Quality**: 4 (best) to 63 (worst)
- **Horizontal Mirror / Vertical Flip**
- **Flash LED**: Requires hardware support (see Flash Safety below)
- **Brightness / Contrast**: -2 to 2

## Flash Safety

The ESP32-CAM's voltage regulator cannot supply the current needed by a typical high-brightness LED (GPIO 4) without risking brownouts, WiFi disconnects, or camera freezes.

- The flash GPIO is **commented out** by default (`// #define LED_FLASH 4`).
- To enable, uncomment that line **only if** you have verified your board's regulator can handle the load, or if you are using an external LED with a transistor driver.
- The firmware enforces a **30-second auto-shutdown** as a safety measure.
- A warning banner appears in the dashboard when flash is enabled.
